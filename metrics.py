    The Global Nestedness Fitness is a variant of NODF that compares the observed level of nestedness with the expected value under a suitable null model.
    This new metrics weighs linearly the contribution of rows and columns (instead of quadratic as in NODF).
    
    This function takes a bidimensional matrix (np.array) and returns its global nestedness score.
